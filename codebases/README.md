# Codebases

This is a list of suggested codebases to explore, grouped by programming
languages.

Keep in mind that all codebases evolve, so the comments here may get out of
date.

## Javascript

- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express): widely used and written in
  plain javascript. This is a great example of how learning the internals of
  something will improve how you use it (or at least you'll understand
  better what you are doing).
- [sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon): has to deal with a lot of language
  edge cases, which may or may not be something you consider fun. Also, you have
  to wonder how something like this is tested.

## Scala

- [scalachess](https://github.com/ornicar/scalachess): written in functional
  style, so it may not be representative of most "real world" scala. Still,
  useful to familiarize yourself with how the language works.

## VimL

- [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary): single file plugin,
  but if you are just starting with VimL you will learn a lot.
- [linediff](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/linediff.vim): a more advanced
  plugin (but not too much). And it has tests, which is a plus.
