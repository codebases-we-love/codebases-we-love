# Organizing an exploration party

The first and most important thing you have to do is to get two (or more) other
people that are interested in doing this. Everything else can be worked out: how
often to meet, if you do it online or in person, how many times you'll do it,
etc. Having said that, we have some tips that worked for us and that may work
for you:

- **Meet once per week**. One week should be more than enough time to do some
  reading. Even if you only manage to put two hours into this, you'll be amazed
  at how many things you learn.
- **Write down what you find**. This will save time when it's your turn to speak
  in the meeting.
- **Designate a moderator**. They don't have many responsibilities: just making sure
  everyone talks and writing down the open questions that come out during the
  meeting (e.g. "I still don't understand how X works" or "I'm curious about
  where Y is used"). Share these with the group after the meeting, so that
  everyone can use them as inspiration in the next round of reading.
- **Do at least three meetings**. Less than that won't make the most of the group
  experience.
- You may want to **agree on how much time to put into this**. If someone dedicates
  15 hours while the rest of the group only manages to dedicate two, the meeting
  will be unbalanced.
